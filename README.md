# Healthcare Data Analysis using SQL & Power BI

## Project Overview
This project analyzes healthcare patient data to uncover insights related to patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital stay duration, and billing patterns. The analysis was performed using SQL for data exploration and Power BI for visualization.

## Dataset
- Patient healthcare dataset
- Records include age, gender, medical condition, admission type, billing amount, admission date, and discharge date

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI
- GitHub

## Key Analysis Performed (SQL)
- Total patient count
- Age distribution (min, max, average)
- Patient distribution by gender
- Patient count by medical condition
- Average billing amount by medical condition
- Average length of stay by admission type
- Data quality checks (invalid admission and discharge dates)

## Power BI Dashboard Insights
- Total patients, average age, and average length of stay
- Length of stay by admission type
- Billing amount by medical condition
- Relationship between billing amount and length of stay
- Medical condition comparison using scatter and bar charts

## Files in This Repository
- `patient_data_analysis.sql` – SQL queries used for data analysis
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end healthcare data analysis workflow using SQL and Power BI. It highlights the ability to extract insights from raw data, validate data quality, and present findings using interactive dashboards.
